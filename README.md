# Hi there, I'm Bram Van Pevenage ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer with 4+ years of experience in Software development. I am passionate about .NET, Java, Scala, ... and have been working on various projects in this field.

## ðŸ”­ Current Project

Currently, I am working on an Image Segmentation project, which involves understanding Scheme and the different alogoritms that exists on graphs. This for the course Algorithms and Datastructures II. The second project for this course is Dynamic Programming, which is also a very interesting topic. Where we need to find an maximum independent vertex in a given graph.
I also have 2 projects for another course calles Parallelism & Distribution (P&D). The first project is about parallelism & concurrency, searching on a large image for certain pixel combination., more concreet searching Amongi on [r/Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place). The second project is about distributed systems, where we have to create a canvas tool just like [r/Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/place), but where the canvas is managed by the different clients who are connected to the canvas.

## ðŸŒ± Learning Journey/Goals

I am continuously learning and growing my skills [@VUB](https://www.vub.be/en) - Brussels University. Currently in my Switching Year, as i already gratuated from the Bachelor of Computer Science @ [Odisee](https://www.odisee.be/en) Higher Education College.
